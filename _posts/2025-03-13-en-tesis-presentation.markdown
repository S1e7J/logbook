## How much did I work?

I worked 7 hours and a half today. Some of those were class hours but in general
I believe is an ok day.

## What was I working on?

I worked in some problems for the statistical physics class but the most
interesting/exciting thing I worked was the first presentation of my tesis.

It was nor big nor complex but it felt really good stating this start as I did.
Here I will try to do something similar.

## Something worty to Share?

### Presentation of the problem

Let's see this next graphics:

At first glance it seems like a random data set. However let us just take more
samples:

![Graphics that now seem periodic](/assets/13-03-2025/sampled.png)

Now it's pretty obvious what the data where hiding. It is periodic.

However, How can we get to now that this was the case when we are talking about
time serialized data in which the samples already happened.

### Real Motivation

In Astronomy there are lots and lots of date. And many times astronomers are just
focused in some type concrete of an object. However, it's slow and hard to pass
the information and filter it to get great categorization. ADP even thought is
agnostic was as it's motivation this categorization for periodic stars.

### Introducing APD (Agnostic Periodicity Detector)

The whole porpouse of our project is to create a detector of periodicity in data
agnostic to the source. We will use Numeric techniques along side with ML thecnics
for periodicity detection. At this point we are just collecting information and
learning about Autocorrelation, Correntropy and other measurements of periodicity.

The scaffold of the plan is to keep learning until june and then begging working
in coding and constructing the tool. We will probably re-do some of the methods
that already exists using some low level code and trying to optimize as our
first goal (We will probably use Fortran and go as deep as needed for speed)

## Cool Links?

Today there is not cool links. I will probably do a Blog Post with my discoveries
in the future. In that case I will linked it here.
