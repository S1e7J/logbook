## How much did I work?

Today was a weird day. If I needed to define it I would probably say "Inconsistent"
I worked for 2 hours really connected and then stay afk for 1 hour and a half. After
that get to work again. It was not that continues but some days are like that.

## What was I working on?

There were three projects that I made today:

1. Statistical Physics Homework
2. Astronomy Presentation
3. DevOps tool for making this logbook

Nothing in here were a big project or some lifechanging experience but I think
today was a cool remix of little works

## Something worty to Share?

The only thing that I finished today was a little Go script that let me create
this kind of logbook post (and honestly any Jekyll entry). I will link this
script in the next section but it's not anything really cool or interesting.

How ever, in not complete work I have some cool things to share. For example,
I'm starting to make my Tesis and it's about periodicity detection. I'm not that
comfortable talking about the details right now because the investigation process
just began but I have encounter some cool points and I will share some of it in this
Blog.

Beginning with the book `Machine Learning for Physics and Astronomy` from Professor
Viviana Acquaviva. I'm not done reeding it but so far it's one of the most elegant
explanaitions I could find and a really good source. I will discuss in more detail
one day where I expend studying it. But it's something cool to share.

In other points statistical physics got really serious this last month. I was
really enjoying the field in the beginning of the semester but this homework is
something else. Maybe is the exam season or something but I felt this homework
more heavy and difficult than any of the previous one.
