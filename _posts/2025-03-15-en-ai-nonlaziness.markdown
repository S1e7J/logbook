## How much did I work?

Today was not a particularly productive day. However I worked 4 hours and a half.

## What was I working on?

Today worked primarily in a homework for my university. It was primarily about
the Debye Model in Statistical Physics.

## Something worthy to Share?

Today I wanted to speak about how AI may be too little Lazy. The thing is, I truly
believe that laziness and cleverness are far more important than doing _the job_.
There is beauty in finding a simpler way for doing things. Of course that doesn't
mean that working hard is some type of bad thing. But, if you're working hard and
there is a way to make things simpler and get exactly the same benefits. I don't
know why you should do the hard thing. Just for a second lets pause here and talk
about something. I love learning, and I'm completely aware that learning is better
when you put effort into it. When you are considering the benefits take in
consideration what you learned. Maybe some times you should do the hard work and
just swallow the frog.

However, AI has no concept of laziness. Let me show you a simple example. I
have these two questions:

* (a)

    Starting from the definition of the partition function for a quantum harmonic
    oscillator, show that the partition function can be written as

    $$
    Z_1 = \frac{1}{2\sinh\!\left(\frac{\beta\hbar\omega}{2}\right)}.
    $$

* (b)

    Then, by considering a system of independent oscillators, deduce that the total
    partition function is given by

    $$
    Z_N = \prod_{v} \frac{1}{2\sinh\!\left(\frac{\beta\hbar\omega(v)}{2}\right)},
    $$

    and consequently derive the Helmholtz free energy as

    $$
    F = \sum_{v} \left( \hbar \omega \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{\beta}\ln \left(1 - e^{-\beta\hbar\omega}\right)\right) \\
    $$

It's a simple point without too much trouble. However, when you tried to solve
it is really stupid to use
the results of A in B without hesitation. I'm not sure if this is going to be
understandable without a lot of context but lets try to solve it:

* Solve (a)
    We got the definition so the only thing left is to resolve:
    $$
    \begin{align*}
        Z &= \sum_{i = 0}^{\infty} e^{-\beta E_i}\\
        Z_1 &= \sum_{i = 0}^{\infty} e^{-\beta \hbar \omega
    \left( n + \frac{1}{2} \right)}\\
        &= \sum_{i = 0}^{\infty} e^{-\beta \hbar \omega n}  e^{- \beta \hbar \omega\frac{1}{2}}\\
        &= e^{- \beta \hbar \omega\frac{1}{2}} \sum_{i = 0}^{\infty}
    e^{-\beta \hbar \omega n}  \\
        &= e^{- \beta \hbar \omega\frac{1}{2}} \sum_{i = 0}^{\infty}
    \left(e^{-\beta \hbar \omega }\right)^n  \\
        \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} y^n &= \frac{1}{1 - y} \text{ Geometric Series}\\
        Z_1 &= e^{-\beta \hbar \omega \frac{1}{2}} \frac{1}{1 - e^{-\beta\hbar\omega}}\\
        &=  \frac{1}{e^{-\beta \hbar \omega \frac{1}{2}}\left(1 - e^{-\beta\hbar\omega}\right)}\\
        &=  \frac{1}{e^{-\beta \hbar \omega \frac{1}{2}} - e^{-\frac{1}{2}\beta\hbar\omega}}\\
        &=  \frac{1}{e^{-\beta \hbar \omega \frac{1}{2}} -
    e^{-\frac{1}{2}\beta\hbar\omega}} \frac{2}{2} \\
        &=  \frac{2}{e^{-\beta \hbar \omega \frac{1}{2}} -
    e^{-\frac{1}{2}\beta\hbar\omega}} \frac{1}{2} \\
        &=  \frac{1}{\sinh\left( \frac{\beta \hbar \omega}{2} \right) 2}  \\
        &=  \left[{\sinh\left( \frac{\beta \hbar \omega}{2} \right) 2}\right]^{-1}\square\\
    \end{align*}
    $$

    I tried in an effort for simplicity to put all middle steps in here. I'm not
    sure if it will trash credibility but if you didn't get it don't worry. The
    only important step is to see that

    $$
        Z_1 = e^{-\beta \hbar \omega \frac{1}{2}} \frac{1}{1 - e^{-\beta\hbar\omega}}\\
    $$

    is a middle point.

* Solve (b)
    Let's see what we are seeking is basically

    $$
    F = - \frac{1}{\beta}\sum_v \ln Z_1 =
    \sum_{v} \left( \hbar \omega \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{\beta}\ln \left(1 - e^{-\beta\hbar\omega}\right)\right) \\
    $$

    And of course, you could just plug in the result of the last point and do a
    bunch of trigonometry on top of the logarithm properties. However, If you just
    zoom out a little bit and get in consideration the thing I said before, the
    solution is essentially trivial. Let's look at it

    $$
    \begin{align*}
        F &= - \frac{1}{\beta} \sum_{v} \ln Z_1\\
        Z_1 &= e^{-\beta \hbar \omega \frac{1}{2}} \frac{1}{1 - e^{-\beta\hbar\omega}}\\
        F &= - \frac{1}{\beta} \sum_{v} \ln e^{-\beta \hbar \omega \frac{1}{2}} \frac{1}{1 - e^{-\beta\hbar\omega}} \\
        &= - \frac{1}{\beta} \sum_{v} \left(\ln e^{-\beta \hbar \omega
    \frac{1}{2}} - \ln 1 - e^{-\beta\hbar\omega}\right) \\
        &= - \frac{1}{\beta} \sum_{v} \left( -\beta \hbar \omega \frac{1}{2} - \ln 1 - e^{-\beta\hbar\omega}\right) \\
        &= \sum_{v} \left(\frac{1}{\beta}\beta \hbar \omega \frac{1}{2} +
    \frac{1}{\beta}\ln \left(1 - e^{-\beta\hbar\omega}\right)\right) \\
        &= \sum_{v} \left( \hbar \omega \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{\beta}\ln \left(1 - e^{-\beta\hbar\omega}\right)\right) \\
        &= \sum_{v} F_v\square
    \end{align*}
    $$

The solution was basically free for you to take it. The other route was longer,
bulkier and uglier. However, do you know what route all the models suggested me when
I asked? the solution in which I have to know trigonometry and use many more weird
relations. It isn't the case that by doing it they were more correct.
It's ok what I
did. I spent a good amount of time trying to get the AI into doing it this way
without saying it directly. However, every time I tried it was a failed attempt.
Of course it could do it. The answer and the route were right most of the time.
But it was such a waste of time doing it that way that made me have this conclusion.

AI biggest problem it's not lazy. It doesn't have any problem bringing trigonometry
or higher order mathematics (In one solution it brought up the Riemann Zeta Function,
it was correct but I almost fell off my chair laughing for doing
so in a strictly real
environment and literally just for the Basilean Problem). It knows all these ways
but getting the best and simplest result is not a matter of knowledge. It's a matter
of taste and laziness.

## Cool Links?

I don't have any link today. Maybe tomorrow or Monday I will link my work and solution
for this problem. So long
